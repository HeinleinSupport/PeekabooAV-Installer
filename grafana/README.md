## After the installation

Connect to Grafana on port `3000`
and login with `admin:admin`


from there you can add the two data sources (cuckoo and peekaboo) and then install the dashboards:

Both data sources are type MysSQL. You can get the credentials from ```/opt/peekaboo/etc/peekaboo.conf``` and ```/var/lib/cuckoo/.cuckoo/conf/cuckoo.conf``` since the installer generates some random passwords for the db connections.

Lastly import the predefined dashboards with their grafana.com id:

`6306`	PeekabooAV_v3

`6309`	PeekabooAV drill down - Detailed Job Info
