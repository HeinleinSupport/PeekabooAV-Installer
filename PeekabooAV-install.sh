Welcome to the PeekabooAV installer
===================================

we assume the following:
- you want to install or update PeekabooAV
- this is a Ubuntu 18.04 VM
- /etc/hostname is a valid FQDN
- nothing else runs on this machine
- you run this installer as root
- you know what you're doing!

we will:
- activate the universe (ansible) and multiverse (rar/unrar) repositories
- install latest updates (apt-get dist-upgrade)
- install ansible
- install various system packages which are dependencies for Cuckoo and Peekaboo
- install Cuckoo and Peekaboo with their python dependencies into virtualenvs in /opt

Things are Done
===============

now there is a user called peekaboo whose home is at /var/lib/peekaboo

assuming you've done this:
- installed and replicated your VMs on your vmhost
- configured networking properly
- configured some mail thing on the host
- configured cuckoo properly to know and use your VMs

now it's your turn to do the following:
- configure vmhost to allow SSH connections from $HOSTNAME (.ssh/authorized_keys)
- configure static ip in /etc/network/interfaces
- check dataflow through mail, amavis, peekaboo, cuckoo
- reboot & snapshot

That's it well done

Thanks
have a nice day
